# Introduction
Greetings! You have stumbled upon the work area for Dungeonz, the free, open-source, browser based, massively multiplayer online RPG.

This area is intended for potential contributors who are interested in the project, but don't know where to begin. Any info that someone might want to find about joining and working on the project will probably be here somewhere, and if not, let me know and I'll update this documentation.

Dungeonz is open-source, meaning that anyone is free to see all aspects of how the game works on a technical level, and can also contribute to the project, such as adding new creatures, items, dungeons, balancing, fixing bugs, and whatever else will make the game better.

Here you can find basically everything that goes into the game, what is currently being worked on, and how you can help!

The creation of Dungeonz is a collaborative effort, with content and mechanics able to be added by members of the community.

It is a non-commercial project, so there are no promises of "rev-share" or "backpay when the game makes money" or whatever. That isn't the goal here.
This project is ideal for beginners, hobbyists, students, portfolio builders, work experience seekers, and of course regular players of the game curious to see how the magic happens.

## Getting started
First, you should have [played the game](https://dungeonz.io/) to get a feel for what it is like, what has been done so far, what looks lacking, and to generally get a good context for what you might want to get started with.

The main contribution areas are code, audio, visual, with other smaller ones like mapping, balance, translations and testing.

You probably came to this project already specialising in one of these. There are guides tailored for contributors that describe the general requirements for each field, that you can jump to if you just want to skip whatever doesn't apply to you.

## Contributing
With so many moving parts to a video game, especially a one like this, it is important to keep the project managed well. I try to run the project like you would find in an actual software company, where each thing being worked on should be detailed, tracked, completed (or cancelled), tested and finally added to the game.

This is done using the main tasks backlog on the GitHub issues page: https://github.com/Arcanorum/dungeonz/issues

This is where pretty much everything that is proposed to change about the game should start
From initial development through to being added to the live game, things should be in this backlog in some way.


## Basic info

# Tooling - *What engine do you use?*

This game doesn't use an off the shelf game engine/centralised project manangement GUI, like Unity, Unreal, GameMaker, etc.

As a game that is also a website, it uses many of the tools of the web development trade. The "engine" is a custom setup that brings together various free tools that are each specialised for a certain task., to cover JavaScript files that are built and run by NodeJS, which is a program for running JavaScript outside of a web browser.
