07/05/2021 - Update 9 - City redesign, chat, content

New:

    An introduction area with weak enemies that players can progress through easily without getting lost.
    New players now spawn with some basic items to get them going.

    - Desert
    - Vampire island

    Each spell from the books has been split out into it's own item.
- Refresh page death penalty:

16/11/2020 - Update 7 - Darkness
An ominous veil of darkness has fell upon the world, ushering in a new age of uncertainty for the denizens of Munud City.
Strange figures have been reported swarming in the shadows at night, mauling any creature foolish enough to wander near...

Could this be related to the recent appearance of more drawfs in the known lands? Have they brought this curse with them, or 
were they fleeing from it themselves? Perhaps a journey into the western mountains will reveal the mystery of this adumbral plague...

    - Some creatures now only spawn during certain times of day.
    - Some dungeons are now always at night, such as underground locations.

28/04/2019 - Update 4 - Shadow dōjō:

Reports suggest this is unlikely to be the work of common bandits, but instead a more highly trained and dangerous form of outlaw.

- Fixed being able to go over the stat level cap if you joined the game with more than the level cap's worth of exp.

- Pushing effects (wind staff, hammers) can no longer push players in a safe zone.
- Key dropping creatures in dungeons now only drop 1 key.
- Key dropping creatures in dungeons now force respawn at their intended area when the boss respawns, to avoid them getting stuck behind locked doors for which their own key is needed to get past.
